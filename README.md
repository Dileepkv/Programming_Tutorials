# CAN 101
Tutorials for people new to REVO programming.

This will cover not only how to program ATmegas, but also all the things you need to know to be a good person! [[+]](NULL "Well, not really. They will probably make you a worse person") 
*NOTE: Don't click the link, it is only hovertext (check the FAQ)*

Clone this repo to get example code for the tutorials! Follow along! Also make bug requests for typos and whatnot, or make pull-requests if you are super nice! [[+]](NULL "<3")

Some useful files are also in the main folder, such as the ATmega datasheet and the pinouts in a readable form[[+]](NULL "The datasheet has a terrible format for the pinouts, and it is really hard to read. I painstakingly transcribed them into a text document.")

## Tutorials
##### Tut 1 - Setup
Set up your system and get the necessary tools to program ATmegas!

##### Tut 2 - Wiring and Flashing
Learn to wire up and flash code onto an ATmega. 

##### Tut 3 - Blinky: How Do You Do?
Learn what "blinky" does line by line.

##### Tut 4 - Inputs & Outputs
Learn to use digital inputs, analog inputs and analog outputs. From this point on, you can basically do everything with an ATmega.

##### Tut 5 - Interrupts
Interrupts on an ATmega. You might think you know it all, but you don't! Learn to program like the pros. 

##### Learn Git
A general overview of how to use Git and how we are using git for our project. Remember to never push to master.[[+]](null "DON'T DO IT!")

##### Style-Guide
The general code style that we will use. Also includes some comments about commenting your code. 

## Soon to come Tutorials[[+]](null "Maybe")

##### Tut 6 - CAN
CAN and how to use it on an ATmega, and how to use our API. 

##### Learn C
A general guide on how to program in C.

## FAQ
##### I Don't know C, What do I do?
I will work on writing a quick learn-C tutorial thingy. But it won't go too in-depth. If you really want to learn, there are a ton of great resources out there!

Learn C the Hard Way is a pretty good starter, and honestly just reading anything you can get your hands on will help.

##### Why isn't there a tutorial for (INSERT HERE)
It is actually time consuming to write tutorials. I will probably get around to it eventually if it is important.

##### Why are there links that lead to (NULL)?
These are hover-texts! [[+]](NULL "Hi I am hovertext") A jank[[+]](null "So jank") way of forcing github to display text[[+]](null "Like me!") when you hover. They require a link[[+]](null "Woops! Not a link"), so that is set to NULL[[+]](null "Null is not a valid link so it breaks! Don't click it!")! 

But seriously, don't click unless it says [(LINK)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "See, you can click now!") because otherwise it will send you to a non-existent page or some random page[[+]](http://www.findtheinvisiblecow.com/ "cow? Cow? COW! COW! COW COW COW!!!!") that I find funny.

##### Should I read the hover-texts?
I generally tried to keep all pertinent information in regular text and mostly extra information is hovertext.[[+]](null "Like the fact that I used to own a rabbit.") Some of the extra information is useful and some of it is just me goofing off[[+]](null "I am a serious person and I demand respect!"). I recommend you read all of them mostly because they help break up the monotony of reading technical tutorials.[[+]](null "They are like novels that don't have a plot and kinda just spend the entire book describing the room the main character is sitting in at a great depth.")

##### I am offended by your hover-texts
This is not a question. 

##### You say to never push to master, but *this* repo is entirely made of pushes to master
Pushing to master is fine if you are running solo-dolo. It is a major issue when working in groups. Also I am the exception that proves the rule.[[+]](null "Not only does this argument not make sense, but I also break things all the time by pushing to Master. I also delete data files at my work all the time by accident. My work just tends to be net-positive that people keep me around, at least for now.")
