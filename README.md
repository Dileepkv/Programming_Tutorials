# Programming Tutorials
Tutorials for people new to Olin Electric Motorsports programming.

This will cover not only how to program ATmegas, but also all the things you need to know to be a good person! [[+]](NULL "Well, not really. They will probably make you a worse person") 
*NOTE: Don't click the link, it is only hovertext (check the FAQ)*

Clone this repo to get example code for the tutorials! Follow along! Also make bug requests for typos and whatnot, or make pull-requests if you are super nice! [[+]](NULL "<3")

The `ATmegaTutorials` folder contains tutorials specific to ATmega programming. The `GeneralTutorials` folder contains tutorials related to our team's workflow and things not directly related to ATmegas.

## FAQ
##### I Don't know C, What do I do?
I will work on writing a quick learn-C tutorial thingy. But it won't go too in-depth. If you really want to learn, there are a ton of great resources out there!

Learn C the Hard Way is a pretty good starter, and honestly just reading anything you can get your hands on will help.

##### Why isn't there a tutorial for (INSERT HERE)
It is actually time consuming to write tutorials. I will probably get around to it eventually if it is important.

##### Why are there links that lead to (NULL)?
These are hover-texts! [[+]](NULL "Hi I am hovertext") A jank[[+]](null "So jank") way of forcing github to display text[[+]](null "Like me!") when you hover. They require a link[[+]](null "Woops! Not a link"), so that is set to NULL[[+]](null "Null is not a valid link so it breaks! Don't click it!")! 

But seriously, don't click unless it says [(LINK)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "See, you can click now!") because otherwise it will send you to a non-existent page or some random page[[+]](http://www.findtheinvisiblecow.com/ "cow? Cow? COW! COW! COW COW COW!!!!") that I find funny.

##### Should I read the hover-texts?
I generally tried to keep all pertinent information in regular text and mostly extra information is hovertext.[[+]](null "Like the fact that I used to own a rabbit.") Some of the extra information is useful and some of it is just me goofing off[[+]](null "I am a serious person and I demand respect!"). I recommend you read all of them mostly because they help break up the monotony of reading technical tutorials.[[+]](null "They are like novels that don't have a plot and kinda just spend the entire book describing the room the main character is sitting in at a great depth.")

##### I am offended by your hover-texts
This is not a question. 

##### You say to never push to master, but *this* repo is entirely made of pushes to master
Pushing to master is fine if you are running solo-dolo. It is a major issue when working in groups. Also I am the exception that proves the rule.[[+]](null "Not only does this argument not make sense, but I also break things all the time by pushing to Master. I also delete data files at my work all the time by accident. My work just tends to be net-positive that people keep me around, at least for now.")

##### There are a ton of errors in the Example code!
That is because they are there to test your understanding. You should be able to fix them and make them work after reading the tutorial. Actually, I just wrote them without seeing if they worked so if you find errors just make a pull-request with fixes and I'll merge them.
