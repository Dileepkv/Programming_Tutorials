# How Github works at OEM
You may have used Github before, you may have not. Don't fret if you haven't and even if you have, there's a solid chance you haven't used it like we use it at OEM.

## Repos
Repos serve the purpose of overall project folder. We have multiple repos for tutorials as well (such as the one you are currently in). By putting whole projects in a folder, or "repo", we can more easily track issues, project statues, and more. 
Most likely, during your time at OEM, you won't make a new repo. You will, however, work in multiple different repos.

The most common repo you will be working in is the "MK_III Code" repo. This has all the code that will on on the MK_III car this year.

## Projects
We will be trying to use github pages more this year. You can learn about it more at the homepage of MK_III as well as [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards/).

## Teams
There are two teams at OEM currently. Administrators are the people who wil be reviewing your pull requests, looking at your code, and generally be here for advice and help.

The administration team this year is:
- @segerpeter07  Peter Seger
- @byronwasti    Byron Wasti

## People
Github has great integration with people in an organization. Once you start writing code for OEM, we'll add you as collaborator on Github.
While this doesn't mean you have total control (for obvious reasons), it does mean you become more active on the page.
When other people write project posts, pull requests, open issues, or other tasks on Github, you should tag other relevant people. It's as easy as @name them. Here's an example of a new issue.
